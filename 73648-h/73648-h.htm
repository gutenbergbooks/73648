<h2 class="nobreak">AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CRASH<br>
OF NOVEMBER, 1929</h2>
</div>


<p>By way of comment on the great speculative
epidemic that spread over the country
and indeed throughout the world the past five
or six years, it may be observed that stock
speculation, once considered a hazardous
business, came to be generally regarded as a
safe, dignified and profitable occupation. Of
a certainty it became general, if nothing else.
From a once precarious game of chance, to
be indulged in only by daredevils and millionaires,
it became so simple and well safeguarded
that anyone with a little capital
could in a short time double it and quadruple
it. It was contended that inasmuch as we had
successfully passed the twenty-year cycle in
which, according to precedent, stock market
panics are wont to occur, such disturbances
had been relegated to history, and the Federal
Reserve System obviated any possibility
of their recurrence. This belief pervaded all
classes from millionaires to house servants,
and eventually the entire community became<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
inoculated with the speculative germ. It got
to be the principal topic of conversation in
the clubs, cafes, hotel lobbies, on the street,
and any place where two or more people were
congregated. The many thousands of brokerage
offices throughout the country were
jammed to the doors by eager onlookers and
participants who devoted themselves exclusively
to the market from the opening to the
close. Office boys, elevator men, manicures,
hotel waiters, hairdressers, cab drivers, and
even rural farmers initiated themselves into
the game and discussed mergers, split-ups,
stock dividends, and all such subjects in high
finance with more profuseness and profundity
than was ever displayed at a bankers’
convention.</p>

<p>Indeed for years it looked as if stocks
could only go one way—up. Therefore the
whole speculative fraternity arrayed itself on
the up-side; and it actually happened that
vast numbers of traders who had formerly
bought stocks to sell at only a point or two
profit, now accumulated them to keep indefinitely.
The trading element, emboldened by
one success after another, concluded that we<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
were in a new era—that the stock market
millennium had become a reality. In travel we
advanced from the stage coach to the automobile
and the aeroplane; from the slow sailing
craft to the ocean greyhound. The radio
and the telephone had linked the whole universe
together in conversation, and in the art
of creating wealth the old-fashioned slow-moving
process of conservatism had become
as obsolete as the stage coach. These facts
were all too obvious to be disputed. And to
prove there was simply no limit to modern
inventions the stock market, backed by the
new investment trust scheme, supplied a new
financial vehicle without any reverse gears.
It was fast and easy riding, the sensation was
thrilling, and it required neither skill nor experience
to operate. In 1924-6 during the
try-out period of this marvellous get-rich-quick
machine there were many skeptics who
doubted its safety and efficiency; but confidence
gradually increased and one after another
became convinced, until eventually the
whole populace clambered aboard.</p>

<p>Business was good, the country was rich
and prosperous, and it was argued that a<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
financial structure built upon such confidence
and prosperity could not be shaken by anything
short of a universal earthquake. Basic
values had become so stabilized in the minds
of the people that there was no more reason
to expect them to crumble than there was to
expect the Washington Monument to topple
over. Even the gray-haired wizards of Wall
Street who had preached caution for two or
three years, finally fell into line with the new
order of things, and not only did they plunge
into the market long after it had passed the
point of safety, but they organized more investment
trusts running into billions of dollars,
and advertised far and wide for the
public to buy their stock and join them in
amassing fortunes. They would manage
everything, and all the people had to do was
to furnish the money. These cold-blooded
Wall Street magnates, suddenly converted to
the theory of universal brotherhood, undertook
to espouse the cause in which everybody
works for one another. Verily the Biblical
prophecy was more than fulfilled; for it came
to pass that not only could the lamb lie down
in safety with the lion,—he could feed with<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
him at the Wall Street manger. The public
was thus taken into these co-operative partnerships
and enabled to enjoy all the advantages
to be derived from the superior genius
and directorship of the giants of wealth and
commerce. The small investors and speculators,
highly flattered by the opportunity of
being admitted into such society, threw their
savings into the melting pot with more confidence
than as if they were putting them into
a savings bank. Many of the trusts were
legitimate; others were disguised gambling
pools operating on other people’s money,
along the lines proposed by the late “Tom”
Lawson in the memorable advertising campaign
he conducted in Bay State Gas. In
most cases these gambling ventures were
sponsored by names that inspired confidence;
and those who bought participation certificates
would undoubtedly have won if the
stock market had never stopped going up. It
was generally supposed that such men could
not go financially wrong—and they didn’t;
it was the public that went wrong in buying
their certificates. One company after another
launched its stock with great display advertisements,<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
and no hungry trout ever bit at a
fly with more avidity than the greedy public
gobbled up these “investment” issues. Sober-minded
people marvelled at the spectacle and
wondered where all the money came from. In
dozens of cases the advertisements stated that
the stock had already been oversubscribed,
and the notice appeared only as a matter of
record. And so it happened that time and
again the insatiate public was obliged to restrap
its purse and wait for some new opportunity
to be let in. It got so that many people
felt it was about as difficult to get into these
“closed” issues as it was to gain a membership
in one of New York’s fashionable clubs.</p>

<p>Many of these so-called investment trusts
accumulated thousands upon thousands of
highly speculative common shares that paid
less than 2% income on their market value.
Indeed one day in September, 1929, a statistician
figured that the twelve most active
stocks on the New York Stock Exchange
averaged a return of only one and three-fifths
per cent. on their selling price, and with no
immediate prospect of increased dividends.
With dozens of investment companies hoarding<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
securities, all one had to do was buy
the active stocks, hold them for a big rise,
then unload them onto some new investment
trust. The pot was kept boiling by all sorts of
rumors of stock dividends, split-ups, consolidations
and such-like enticements; and when
things quieted down a bit, someone would
bring out the old reliable rumor that while
the public was taking a breathing spell the
big bankers were quietly accumulating large
lines. It worked like magic on the inflamed
public mind—it always does. If the bankers
are buying, why shouldn’t the public buy?
Another popular device was to broadcast reports
accredited to Messrs. Coolidge &amp; Mellon,
to the effect that after scanning the speculative
horizon they could discover no reason
why the market should not keep on going up.
With such a bulwark of confidence there was
but little reason to be afraid. It did not matter
whether stocks paid small dividends, or
no dividends. It did not matter if money
loaned at ten, twelve, or fifteen per cent. The
rise in values would take care of all that, with
ample to spare. Frequently one day’s advance
in price would cover a whole year’s interest<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
or more. Nor did it matter that brokers’ commissions
had nearly doubled, and that this
gigantic “kitty” was taking millions of dollars
in toll every day. It works on the same
principle as poker: if seven players sit into a
game with a “kitty,” it’s only a question of
time when at least six of them will go broke.
I heard one trader proudly declare that in
three years he had paid his broker upward of
half a million dollars in commissions, and
nearly twice that amount in interest.</p>

<p>Now and again the brokers’ letters and the
comments of financial editors contained notes
of warning, but the public having got the bit
firmly in its teeth was like a runaway team:
it could neither see nor hear anything that
stood in the way of progress. Facts were
more conclusive than theories; and since
those arrayed on the constructive side had
all the advantage in their favor for an almost
uninterrupted period of several years,
they indulged themselves in a delirium of
dreams from which there appeared to be no
awakening. It was as useless to warn people
of the inevitable results as it would be to
warn a young flapper against the approach<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
of old age, or a carousing young sinner that
the Judgment Day is coming. Many speculators
were willing to admit that stocks might
react sometime, but they were too drunk with
prosperity to worry about anything so far in
the future. The one thing that annoyed them
was the occasional appearance of some venturesome
“bear” at their banquet. Whereas
in the past the bulls and bears had regarded
each other as friendly antagonists, the bulls
now came to look upon the bears as the deadly
enemies of bullish society, and for a time this
animal was threatened with total extinction.
Anyone discovered short of stocks was
viewed in about the same light as one caught
with stolen goods; he was punished accordingly
and the feast went merrily on. I know,
because I was one of the offenders. But fortunately
I got off with a light sentence.</p>

<p>In one of the rush seasons when the stock
exchange transactions were running from
three to six million shares a day, with the
tape lagging an hour or more behind, I knew
a man who put in an order to sell a hundred
shares short at $190, with a stop loss order
at ten points above the purchase price, and an<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
hour or so later, without any advice that the
stock had been sold, he got notice that it had
been bought in on his “stop” at $200, resulting
in a loss of a thousand dollars, plus commission.
Next morning, not having received
any notice of the short sale, he concluded that
in the rush of business the order must have
miscarried, and therefore he was long of a
hundred shares, on which by the way he had
a profit of five points. Shortly after the opening
he sold it, and at the same time sold a
hundred shares short. Later in the day he
got word that his selling order of the day
before had been duly executed, but owing to
some mixup it had not been promptly reported.
This made him three hundred shares
short, with the stock climbing a half point or
more between sales. Before the close he covered
the three hundred shares at a loss of
nearly four thousand dollars. The market
looked so strong that he decided to recoup
his loss on the long side, so he bought two
hundred shares. But the following day while
the bulls paused for a resting spell the stock
slipped back nine points, and being a little
upset over the result of his miscalculations,<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
in a fit of disgust he closed out his two hundred
shares at an additional loss of seventeen
hundred dollars. Next day the bulls again
took the stock in hand and advanced it nineteen
points. No wonder such maneuvers
give traders mental intoxication.</p>

<p>The collapse of the Florida real estate
boom—which carried down dozens of banks,—the
great Mississippi flood, the devastating
earthquakes in California, the failure of
a hundred or more banks throughout the
Northwest and such-like calamities had no
more effect on the Wall Street psychology
than they would have had in quelling an epidemic
of smallpox. Some of the more conservative
element, sensing the danger, sold
out their stocks, but after discovering their
mistake they bought them back at much
higher prices and re-joined the procession.
Therefore many traders who had preached
caution or moderation when the market was
thirty, fifty or a hundred points lower, were
found consorting with the most rampant bulls
at the top. I know a man who sold out his
Montgomery Ward at $15.00 a share, and in
1928 after discovering his error in judgment<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
he bought it back at $425.00 a share. It was
generally tipped to go to a $1000—but it
didn’t. After the November crash he told me
he had been “wiped off the map.”</p>

<p>The market rose to such heights that the
selling price of securities listed on the New
York Stock Exchange—to say nothing of
the untold billions listed on other exchanges—reached
a figure far in excess of all the
money in the world. Though it was reiterated
time and time again that customers’ accounts
with brokers were amply protected, they
were of course margined with other securities,
and thus the pyramid grew until it staggered
the imagination even of those who built
it. Now and then the great top-heavy structure
leaned heavily and looked as if it were
coming down; but each time powerful props
were applied and the timid ones who had
run for cover returned with restored confidence.
This, like the old cry of “Wolf!
Wolf!” was repeated so many times that it
got to <a id="Ref_14" href="#BRef_14">be</a> the general impression that there was
no wolf at all.</p>

<p>The old adage that “stocks are made to
sell” gave place to a new slogan, “Stocks are<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
made to buy.” Every sort of industry was incorporated
and over-capitalized, and notwithstanding
the hundreds of millions of new
shares lately issued it was currently reported
that stocks were very scarce; that they had
nearly all gone into “strong hands;” that
they were locked up in strong boxes, and
nothing could shake them out. To test the
truth of this story, I made inquiries among
several brokers and traders of my acquaintance,
with this result: I found that almost
without exception, traders were carrying
more securities on margin than they had ever
owned before, and that a vast number of them
were pyramiding on their profits. I personally
knew one man who prior to Coolidge’s
election had never carried more than two or
three hundred shares, but thereafter he began
buying, and continued to extend his lines until
in September, 1929, he was long of 53,000
shares on which he had a profit of well
upward of a million dollars—a sum far
greater than he had ever dreamed of owning.
On a thousand shares of General Electric he
had a profit of nearly three hundred thousand
dollars. In response to my inquiry if he did<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
not think it wise to cash in a part of his
profits, he regarded me with amazement.
“That,” said he, “is what everybody told me
two years ago. Stocks are all in strong
hands; and this market is going on up for at
least three more years. And besides, if I cash
in I’ll have to pay the government a heavy
tax on my profits.”</p>

<p>The stock market does queer things to
people; and this sort of psychology is one of
its inexplicable effects on the human mind.
Imagine for instance, the absurdity of a doctor,
or a lawyer, or a business man refusing
to collect his accounts in order to escape paying
taxes on the profits! And yet any number
of men, shrewd in their own business or professions,
refused to take stock market profits
on account of the tax. The experience of my
friend with the fifty-three thousand shares
was typical of what happens to those who
become afflicted with this peculiar logic.
Early in November he was forced to drop
half his holdings, and on November 13th he
awoke from his dream to find that his brokers
had closed out his account, leaving him nearly
$15,000 in their debt, and without a dollar to<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
pay it. However, he had the satisfaction of
escaping the government tax.</p>

<p>Among the curious aftermaths of the 1929
crash, was a profusion of printed articles by
well known “financial experts,” each one
searching vainly to find some explanation of
what caused the great cataclysm. Some laid
it onto President Hoover, some fixed the
responsibility on the Federal Reserve Board,
while others attributed it to one cause and
another; but no one seems to have guessed
that it was the distorted psychology of the
traders themselves that brought about their
own ruin. Since nobody likes to be told that
he’s wrong, perhaps those who lost their
money found some consolation in reading
authoritative opinions that the blame was
chargeable to some one other than themselves.
One eminent economist has lately
written many pages of more or less convincing
argument to prove that the liquidation
started in London, Paris and Berlin—as if
it made any real difference where or how it
started. The survivors of a storm-swept area
(also the speculators) are more concerned
with what happened than they are with how<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
the storm began or where it came from.</p>

<p>There is one great mystery worthy of comment;
and that is, how such a tremendous
scaling down in values could have been accomplished
in so short a time without bankrupting
a single one of the major banks or
brokerage firms. The answer must be that
the public stood the loss—as it usually does.
And why not? They had every chance in the
world to get out with fabulous profits. For
more than a year they had the advice, warning
and threats of the Federal Reserve Board
displayed on the pages of all the newspapers,
and dinned into their ears. But whenever
these warnings or any other danger signal
appeared, the market manipulators showed
their contempt by promptly pushing prices
up a few more points. They defied and
scoffed at every principle of common sense
and business economics, and they got away
with it so long and successfully that it seemed
they were bound by no laws or limitations
except those of their own devising. For years
the market was under the dominion of a new
generation of dare-devil cliques who manipulated
it with an iron arm more daring and<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
more dogmatic than the rule of any tyrant in
history; and month after month the cool-headed
non-participants read the financial
pages with gaping amazement. If the weekly
bank statement showed that brokers’ loans
had increased a hundred millions or more
beyond expectations, it was the signal for a
new outburst of bullish enthusiasm; if the
interest rates were advanced or even doubled,
millions of shares were immediately churned
back and forth at advancing prices, in order
to prove that the laws of gravity and economics
had become subservient to the will of
the speculative mob. It happened repeatedly
that after some large corporation had issued
an unexpectedly poor earnings statement, the
stock of that company was immediately taken
in hand and forced up several points, on the
argument that the “bad news is all out,” and
had already been fully discounted. And on
the theory that a storm-tossed ship is more
apt to sink if standing still than if running
under full steam, the market was pushed
ahead at breakneck speed with compass and
rudder in the hands of a reckless crew that
paid no heed whatever to reefs or shoals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>The Federal Reserve System, instead of
being responsible for the crash, was the one
agency that saved the whole community, including
the banks and brokers, from complete
financial chaos by furnishing at the critical
moment an abundance of money and credit at
low rates.</p>

<p>The theory advanced by some of the economists
that the trading public merely lost
their paper profits, and practically nothing
else was either gained or lost in the tremendous
rise and fall of stocks, is a little misleading.
One authority says: “For the shrinkage
of thirty-five or forty billions of dollars in
stock exchange securities nobody is any
poorer but on account of things possessed
and consumed too soon.” Assuming that the
market started at a given point in 1924 and
reacted to that point in 1929, it would mean
a loss of many hundreds of millions in commissions
and interest. It is estimated that in
1929 alone the commissions for transactions
on the two “Big Boards” amounted to well
upward of five hundred million dollars. Most
of the margin traders lost all of their original
investment, and many of them all they could<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
borrow on their notes, their life insurance
policies, and even their homes.</p>

<p>All this by way of retrospect. The vital
question that confronts us is: will traders
and investors profit by the experience? Apparently
not. The survivors of the late catastrophe
promptly formed a “wrecking crew,”
and are at the present moment busily engaged
in rebuilding the market structure on
pretty much the same lines as before. The
rumor band has been reorganized and is piping
its old-time music into the ears of all
listeners. The tipsters are also lined up, and
with the cheery cry that the storm is all over
they are wheedling and coaxing the public to
come out of the storm cellars and get aboard
the reconstruction train. They harp persistently
on the fact that stocks are cheap,—not
because of their dividend return, but because
they are selling much below the boom prices.
Their calculations are drawn mostly from
figures at the big end of the measuring tape.
Improved business—which exists more in
the imagination than in fact—is employed
as a smoke screen to hide the fact that the
great majority of the active stocks are still<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
selling far above a reasonable investment
basis. At their present prices ten of the best
known representative common stocks,—U.
S. Steel, General Electric, Westinghouse
Electric, Atchison, American Tobacco, Radio,
Consolidated Gas, American &amp; Foreign
Power, Columbia Gas and Johns-Manville,
pay an average return of two and nine-tenths
per cent. In other words, at going prices if
you bought one share each of these ten stocks
the total cost would be $1425 on which you
would receive an annual dividend of $41.60,
or less than the return on U. S. Government
bonds. It is therefore clear that a bull market
constructed on this basis must be a highly
speculative affair.</p>

<p>In February, 1930, the financial editor of
the New York Herald Tribune printed the
following comment:—</p>

<p>“The upward pace of the stock market
leads one to believe that the financial district
is up to its old trick of discounting in advance
the recovery of business from the
trough it now finds itself in. To the observation
that it is going too fast, one can only
agree, and add: ‘It always does.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>The old split-up, consolidation and stock-dividend
chestnuts are being industriously
warmed over and the few scattering traders
who saved something out of the recent smash
are beginning to nibble at the bait. All of
which shows that people are quick to forget
their stock market troubles and to return for
more punishment. I make this observation
in the light of many painful recollections of
earlier days.</p>

<p>The grist of stocks issued in the recent past
is almost incalculable. There are now six industrial
companies with an aggregate capital
of 171,927,540 shares outstanding; and from
the side lines it looks as if there ought to be
time enough to start another boom when the
stock market gets over its present case of
indigestion.</p>

<p>In the final analysis the following essentials
should be constantly borne in mind:
<em>The stock and grain markets are always capable
of playing new tricks on you—of doing
things you never dreamed of.</em> Who, for example,
could have imagined that with a world
shortage of wheat, that staple commodity
would be selling in February at considerably<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
under ninety cents a bushel—nearly as low
as corn!</p>

<p>Another important thing always to remember
is, <em>not to buy more stocks than you can
pay for, or margin far below the lowest point
you think they can possibly reach. The extra
profits to be derived from over-trading are
scarcely ever worth the risk incurred.</em></p>

<p>To sum up the whole situation in a word,
those who would make money speculating in
the stock market should first understand that
it requires as much caution and business acumen
as any other money-making enterprise,
plus some knowledge of the psychological
handicaps; also plus the rare faculty of maintaining
a complete mastery over one’s impulses,
emotions and ambitions under the
most heroic tests of human endurance. All
speculations, and even the most conservative
investments, have at least some slight element
of risk; all lines of business are more or less a
gamble; marriage is a gamble; political preferment
is a gamble; in fact nearly everything
in life, including our very existence, is
an uncertainty; yet people are not thereby
discouraged from entering into any and all<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
of these ventures. Those who look only for
certainties have far to search and little to
find in this world.</p>
